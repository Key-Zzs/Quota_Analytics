# Quota Analytics

Quota Analytics is an unofficial cross-platform quota analytics app for tracking
usage limits, refresh windows, remaining quota, and quota status.

## Disclaimer

This is an unofficial independent project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed
by, or maintained by OpenAI, ChatGPT, or Codex.

Stage 5 adds a local parser for the redacted visible text produced by Stage 4.
Extraction happens only after the user taps the button, reads only
`document.body.innerText`, redacts the result locally, and stores only a bounded
redacted preview for debugging. Parsing happens locally, shows confidence, and
requires explicit user confirmation before a parsed snapshot is saved. The app
still does not read cookies, tokens, passwords, browser storage contents, local
browser profiles, credentials, or an official quota API.

## Current Status

Stage 5: local quota parser with confidence levels is complete.

- Flutter Android-first implementation.
- Mock quota dashboard.
- Mock manual refresh.
- Last mock snapshot restore on startup.
- Bounded mock snapshot history.
- Persisted auto-refresh and refresh interval settings.
- Official Web Login page using `webview_flutter`.
- Users can manually open the official login page inside the app WebView.
- Usage page placeholder entry exists for future confirmation.
- Users can manually extract visible text from the current WebView page.
- Extracted text is redacted before display and local storage.
- Users can manually parse the current redacted visible text.
- Parser results include confidence, warnings, errors, matched signals, window
  fields, credits, and evidence labels.
- Parser results are local and may be inaccurate.
- Parsed snapshots require manual save and are marked with source and parser
  confidence.
- WebView status shows sanitized URL, title, loading progress, navigation time,
  last error, and conservative auth status.
- The app still does not read real quota data.
- The app still does not read cookie/token values.
- The app still does not read localStorage or sessionStorage.
- The app still does not extract HTML.
- The app still does not upload parser input or output.
- The app still does not run automatic or background refresh.
- Settings page with explicit save and clear-local-data.
- Debug page with persistence diagnostics, WebView status, Stage 4 extraction,
  and Stage 5 parser safety flags.
- Clean, feature-first layered architecture.

## Features

  and secret/password/token key-value values.
- Local cache for the most recent redacted extracted preview only.
- Local quota parser for redacted visible text.
- Parse result UI with confidence, warnings, errors, windows, credits, and
  evidence labels.
- Optional user-confirmed save for high/medium parsed snapshots.
- Debug information page with storage diagnostics.
- Clear local data with confirmation.
- Light and dark Material 3 themes.
- Unit and widget tests for persistence, WebView safety, extraction redaction,
  URL safety, parser behavior, parser mapping, parser controller state, and UI.

## Architecture

The app is built with Flutter and organized with a feature-first layered
architecture:

- `domain`: typed entities, repository contracts, and use cases.
- `data`: mock data source, models, and repository implementation.
- `presentation`: controllers, pages, and widgets.

The quota feature depends on a `QuotaRepository` abstraction. Stage 2 ships a
`MockQuotaDataSource`, `LocalQuotaDataSource`, and `PersistentQuotaRepository`;
the UI talks through use cases and controllers rather than directly reading data
sources or `shared_preferences`.

The auth feature owns the WebView login container through
`WebAuthConfig`, `WebAuthRepository`, `WebViewAuthController`, and the
`WebViewLoginPage`. It is intentionally separate from the quota data source and
parser pipeline so login navigation cannot accidentally become quota
extraction.

The extraction feature owns the Stage 4 manual text extraction flow through
`PageTextExtractionRepository`, `WebViewTextExtractionDataSource`,
`LocalExtractedTextDataSource`, `TextRedactor`, and
`PageTextExtractionController`. It reads only `document.body.innerText` after a
user action and never reads cookies, tokens, storage, HTML, request headers, or
network responses.

The parser feature owns the Stage 5 local parser through `QuotaParseResult`,
`RegexQuotaParser`, `QuotaParserController`, `ParseResultCard`, and
`ParseResultToQuotaSnapshotMapper`. It consumes only redacted visible text and
can map high/medium parse results to `QuotaSnapshot` previews with
`source: webViewManualExtraction`.

Future source placeholders include:

- `WebViewQuotaDataSource` for a future reviewed usage extraction stage.
- `OfficialApiQuotaDataSource` if a stable official quota API becomes available.
- `DesktopAgentQuotaDataSource` for local desktop helpers.
- Browser extension integration.
- Wearable clients.

## Getting Started

This project was prepared with Flutter 3.38.10 stable and Dart 3.10.9.

Install dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

Run static analysis:

```sh
flutter analyze
```

Run tests:

```sh
flutter test
```

Run the app:

```sh
flutter run
```

## Development Notes

- Stage 5 WebView network access is limited to user-driven official-site
  navigation inside the app WebView.
- Stage 5 persists mock quota data/settings, the last redacted extracted text
  preview, and user-confirmed parsed snapshot previews.
- Do not add automatic refresh, background refresh, storage reads, or network
  upload without a new security review.
- Do not store credentials.

## Roadmap

- [x] Stage 1: Architecture + Mock UI
- [x] Stage 2: Local persistence for snapshots and settings
- [x] Stage 3: WebView login container
- [x] Stage 4: Usage page text extraction
- [x] Stage 5: Quota parser with confidence levels
- [ ] Stage 6: Real manual refresh flow
- [ ] Stage 7: Foreground auto refresh
- [ ] Stage 8: Android background refresh and notifications
- [ ] Stage 9: iOS adaptation
- [ ] Stage 10: Desktop / wearable clients
- [ ] Stage 11: Optional official API adapter if a stable API becomes available

## Security And Privacy

- No password storage.
- No cookie reading or upload.
- No token scraping.
- No localStorage or sessionStorage reading.
- No WebView HTML extraction.
- Manual WebView text extraction reads only `document.body.innerText`.
- Extracted text remains local and only a redacted preview is saved.
- Parser works on redacted visible text only.
- Parser results are local and may be inaccurate.
- Low-confidence parser results are not saveable as snapshots.
- No automatic or background refresh.
- No analytics SDK by default.
- Debug extracted text should be treated as sensitive even after redaction.
